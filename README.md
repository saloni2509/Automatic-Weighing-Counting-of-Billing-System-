# Automatic-Weighing-Counting-of-Billing-System-
Agricultural project designed for farmers to automate the weighing and costing of farm products and eliminating the data manipulation as well as biased payment to the farmers. 
Designed Jantri machine with an efficiency of 93% eliminating the data manipulation for biased payment to farmers with the help of CAD, later programmed in PLC (ABB) using HMI. Manufactured the product using drilling, lathe, and hex-saw machines.
Later Generated the code in PLC by taking inputs from load cell and Photocell, later displaying via HMI which then displays the bill with the necessary information of paying bills
